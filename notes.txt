Still want:
Have some sides be darker (for example the north and west sides or something)
 	to have an impression of lighting
Rotating camera up down.
Being able to jump and crouch
Keys for the doors

Big maybe:
Portals (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnWRs_BBgXc)
Reflections

Really big maybe
Slopes (like in doom)


MAP EDITOR:

/*Saves the entire tilemap to a text file
	plane gridpos is for the 3 planes. Plane0 for walls and doors. Plane1 for objects and plane2 for enemies
	Format: 
	MapSize x y
	gridSize
	file containing textures needed (or might just have a seperate file which links tilenumbers to textures)
	x y plane tile_id,

	so the x y plane and tile_id are seperated by a space and then 
	each "tile" of data (xyplane id) is seperated by a comma
*/

Map format:
evertything seperated by spaces
tile can be a value from 0-255

starts with map_width and map_height
then gridsize of the tiles (64 or 128 probably)
maptype or map_level
file with all used textures
x y tile

map_w map_h
