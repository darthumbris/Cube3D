Cube3d:

Fov (wolfenstein3d had 70 at 4:3 (around 100 degrees at 16:9)
Probably should set it at 90 degrees

Maybe implement anisotropic filtering? (bonus only and a big maybe)
Do we use a smaller window and scale it ? (if possible/easy to do)

Have an fps counter? 
Can use the delta time of mlx_handle for that

Have the floor and ceiling be in a separate image (background image)should save on calculations hopefully.
And makes it easier for the floor and ceiling to be made of textures.

Maybe have the fast inverse square root function from doom? (just for fun, maybe for optimiazition)
