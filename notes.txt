Fov (wolfenstein3d had 70 at 4:3 (around 100 degrees at 16:9)
Probably should set it at 90 degrees

Do we use a smaller window and scale it ? (if possible/easy to do)

Have the floor and ceiling be in a separate image (background image)should save on calculations hopefully.
And makes it easier for the floor and ceiling to be made of textures.

Maybe have the fast inverse square root function from doom? (just for fun, maybe for optimiazition)

Have some sides be darker (for example the north and west sides or something) to have an impression of lighting

For bonus:

Needed:

Wall collisions!!
Minimap
Doors which can open and close
Animated sprites
Rotating with the mouse.

Want:

Ceiling and floor have textures
Enemies
Rotating camera up down.
Transparency
Have an fps counter? 
Can use the delta time of mlx_handle for that

Maybe:
have multiple textures for the floor and ceiling
have extra textures for the walls
Keys for the doors
Reflections
Portals (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnWRs_BBgXc)
Sprite for the player (hand/weapon)
UI (health etc.)

Big maybe:
Slopes (like in doom)
Maybe implement anisotropic filtering?
